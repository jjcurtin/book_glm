# Sampling Distributions, Parameters, and Parameter Estimates

## Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics are used to estimate *parameters* in the population from parameter estimates in a sample drawn from that population. 
\
\
In inferential statistics, we use these parameter estimates to test hypotheses (predictions; null and alternative hypotheses) about the size of the population parameter. 
\
\
These predictions about the size of population parameters typically map directly onto research questions about (causal) relationships between variables (IVs and DV).
\
\
Answers from inferential statistics are **probabilistic**. In other words, all answers have the potential to be wrong and you will provide an index of that probability along with your results.
