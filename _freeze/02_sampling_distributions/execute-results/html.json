In other words, all conclusions have the potential to be wrong and you will provide an index of that probability along with your results. \n\n-----\n\n## Populations\n\nA population is any clearly defined set of objects or events (people, occurrences, animals, etc.)\n\n- Populations usually represent all events in a particular class (e.g., all college students, all alcoholics, all depressed people, all people)\n- It is often an abstract concept because in many/most instances you will never have access to the entire population\n- Many of our studies may have the population of **all people** as its implicit target\n\n\\\n\\\n\nResearchers usually want to describe or draw conclusions about populations\n\n- We don't care if some new drug is an effective treatment for 100 people in your sample\n- Instead, we want to know if it will, on average, for everyone we might treat \n\n-----\n\n## (Population) Parameters\n\nA parameter is a value used to describe a certain characteristic of a population\n\nFor example, the population mean is a parameter that is often used to indicate the average/typical value of a variable in the population\n\n- The value for a population parameter is a fixed and does not vary within the population at the time of measurement (e.g., the mean height of people in the US at the present moment).\n- The value for a population parameter is usually unknown and can't be calculated directly because we dont have access to the entire population.\n- We use Greek letters to represent population parameters ($\\mu$, $\\sigma$, $\\sigma^2$, $\\beta_0$, $\\beta_j$).\n\n-----\n\n## Samples & Parameter Estimates\n\nA sample is a finite group of units (e.g., participants) selected from the population of interest.\n\n- A sample is generally selected for a study because the population is too large to study in its entirety\n- We typically have only one sample in a study\n- Samples can be selected randomly or not (e.g., convenience samples) from the population, which has implications for the conclusions we reach but not necessarily for the analyses.\n\n\\\n\\\n\nWe use the sample to estimate and test parameters in the population\n\n- These estimates are called parameter estimates.\n- We use Roman letters to represent sample parameter estimates ($\\overline{X}$, $s$, $s^2$, $b_0$, $b_j$).\n\n-----\n\n## Sampling Error\n\nSince a sample does not include all members of the population, the value for any parameter estimate from any specific sample generally differs from the associated parameter from the entire population\n\n- For example, the mean height of a sample of 1000 people drawn randomly from the US population will not exactly match the mean height of US population\n- This difference between the (sample) parameter estimate and the (population) parameter is called sampling error\n\n\\\n\\\n\nYou will not be able to calculate the sampling error of your parameter estimate directly because you don't know the value of the population parameter. However, you can estimate it by probabilistic modeling of the **hypothetical sampling distibution** for that parameter.\n\n-----\n\n## Hypothetical Sampling Distribution\n\nA sampling distribution is a probability distribution for a parameter estimate drawn from all possible samples of size $N$ taken from that population.\n\n- A sampling distribution can be formed for any population parameter.\n- Each time you draw a sample of size $N$ from a population you can calculate an estimate of that population parameter from that sample.\n- Because of sampling error, these parameter estimates will not exactly equal the population parameter. They will not equal each other either. They will form a distribution.\n- A sampling distribution is an abstract concept that represents the outcome of repeated (infinite) sampling. You will typically only have one sample.\n\n-----\n\n## What if we didn't need samples?\n\n***Research question:*** How do inhabitants of a remote pacific island feel about the ocean? Population size = 10,000.\n\n\\\n\n***Dependent measure:*** Ocean liking scale scores that range from -100 (strongly dislike) to 100 (strongly like). 0 represents neutral.\n\n\\\n\n***Hypotheses:*** $H_0: \\mu = 0; H_a: \\mu \\neq 0$ \n\n\\\n\n<span style=\"color: red;\">Question: How would you answer this question if you had unlimited resources (e.g., time, money, and patience)?</span>\n\n-----\n\n<span style=\"color: red;\">Question: How would you answer this question if you had unlimited resources (e.g., time, money, and patience)?</span>\n\n\\\n\n<span style=\"color: blue;\">Administer the Ocean liking scale to all 10,000 inhabitants in the population and calculate the population mean score.

This line of code will tell will tell us when we load two packages with conflicting functions (i.e., they have the same name) by producing an error. There are ways to set custom conflict policies and work around conflicts (e.g., only loading certain functions from a package). You can find more documentation [here](https://jjcurtin.github.io/book_dwvt/conflicts.html).   \n2. This path points to where your data is and should be a relative path from your R project. \n3. We use the `here()` function in the `here` package (`here::here()`) to define paths within a function. This approach (vs. `file.path()`) works well when using R Projects in quarto notebooks. \n\n-----\n\n`glimpse()` \n\n- can be used to display useful information, like number of rows and column, variable (column) names, a sample of what the data look like, and the class of each variable (e.g., double, character, factor).\n\n- can used by itself (see below) or directly in a pipeline when reading in the the data (e.g., could have been add to the pipline above on a line following `read_csv()`) \n\n\\\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata |> \n  glimpse()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRows: 10,000\nColumns: 2\n$ subid      <dbl> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, …\n$ like_score <dbl> -23.608554, -9.011961, 30.536791, 5.886441, -9.164940, 23.6…\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\n**See also:**    \n`view()` allows you to open up the data frame in a GUI window in RStudio.    \n\n-----\n\n`skim()` and other functions in the `skimr` package are helpful for quick summaries of your data (e.g., missingness, distribution, type of data)\n\n\\\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata |> \n  skimr::skim() # <1>\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\nTable: Data summary\n\n|                         |      |\n|:------------------------|:-----|\n|Name                     |data  |\n|Number of rows           |10000 |\n|Number of columns        |2     |\n|_______________________  |      |\n|Column type frequency:   |      |\n|numeric                  |2     |\n|________________________ |      |\n|Group variables          |None  |\n\n\n**Variable type: numeric**\n\n|skim_variable | n_missing| complete_rate|   mean|      sd|     p0|     p25|    p50|     p75|     p100|hist  |\n|:-------------|---------:|-------------:|------:|-------:|------:|-------:|------:|-------:|--------:|:-----|\n|subid         |         0|             1| 5000.5| 2886.90|   1.00| 2500.75| 5000.5| 7500.25| 10000.00|▇▇▇▇▇ |\n|like_score    |         0|             1|    0.0|   23.67| -86.64|  -16.08|    0.1|   16.14|    84.46|▁▃▇▃▁ |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n1.

Imagine drawing many samples (lets say 1000 samples but in theory, the sampling distribution is infinite) of $N$=10 participants (10 participants in each sample) from your population.\n2. Next, calculate the mean for each of these samples of 10 participants.\n3. Finally, create a histogram (or density plot) of these sample means.\n\n\\\n\\\n\n**Note**: In your research, you don't form a sampling distribution by repeated sampling.
