If you have difficulty joining, please let me know immediately. The TAs and I will respond to all Slack messages within 1 business day (and often much quicker). Please plan accordingly (e.g., weekend messages may not receive a response until Monday). For general questions about class, coding assignments, etc., please post the question to the appropriate public channel. If you have the question, you are probably not alone. For issues relevant only to you (e.g., class absences, accommodations, etc.), you can send a direct message in Slack to me and the TAs. If you DM only me, I will share the DM with the TAs unless you request otherwise. Therefore, it is generally best if you include all three TAs on the DM when you start the thread. In general, we prefer that all course communication occur within Slack rather than by email so that it is centralized in one location.",

The first concepts exam is scheduled for Wednesday, 10/23. The second concepts exam is scheduled during the exam period on Wednesday, December 18 from 8:15 - 9:45 am (room TBD). Please plan your end of semester travel accordingly. The application exams will be assigned at the end of weeks 5 (Friday 10/4), 10 (Friday 11/8), and 15 (Wednesday 12/11).\nThere will also be approximately weekly application assignments, which will involve hands-on application of the material similar to (but shorter than) the application exams. They are assigned Fridays at 5 pm and are due the following Friday at 8:30 am. These application assignments are graded on a pass/fail basis, and together constitute 20% of your total grade.\nFinally, 5% of your grade will be determined by your attendance and participation in lecture and lab.\nFinal letter grades are based on total course percentages as follows:\n\nA: 93 or above\nAB: 88 - 92\nB: 83 - 87\nBC: 78 - 82\nC: 70 - 77\nD: 60-69\nF: &lt; 60",

Academic misconduct includes, but is not limited to, cheating on assignments and exams, stealing exams, sabotaging the work of classmates, submitting fraudulent data, plagiarizing the work of classmates or published and/or online sources, acquiring previously written papers and submitting them (altered or unaltered) for course assignments, collaborating with classmates when such collaboration is not authorized, and assisting fellow students in acts of misconduct.

I believe that AI like ChatGPT will eventually become an incredible tool for data scientists and programmers. As such, I view these advances with excitement. Of course, I don’t plan to assign a grade to ChatGPT so I want to make sure that we are clear on when you can and when you cannot use it.\nGiven that I expect AI like ChatGPT and other LLMs to become a useful tool in our workflow as professionals, now is the time to start to learn how they can help. Therefore, you are free to use them for coding assistance during any of our application assignments AND the application exams. Code from ChatGPT is unlikely to be sufficient in either context (and my testing suggests it can be flat out wrong in some instances!) but I suspect that it will still be useful.\nIn contrast, you cannot use ChatGPT or other LLMs/AI to answer the conceptual questions on the conceptual exams. Those questions are designed to assess your working knowledge about concepts and best practices. That information must be in YOUR head and I want to be 100% clear that use of ChatGPT/AI (or any other sources other than what is in your head) to answer those questions will be considered cheating and handled as such if detected. There will be a zero tolerance policy for such cheating and it will be considered academic misconduct and disciplined as such. ## Accommodations Policies McBurney Disability Resource Center syllabus statement: “The University of Wisconsin- Madison supports the right of all enrolled students to a full and equal educational opportunity. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Wisconsin State Statute (36.12), and UW-Madison policy (Faculty Document 1071) require that students with disabilities be reasonably accommodated in instruction and campus life. Reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities is a shared faculty and student responsibility. Students are expected to inform faculty [me] of their need for instructional accommodations by the end of the third week of the semester, or as soon as possible after a disability has been incurred or recognized. Faculty [I], will work either directly with the student [you] or in coordination with the McBurney Center to identify and provide reasonable instructional accommodations. Disability information, including instructional accommodations as part of a student’s educational record, is confidential and protected under FERPA.” http://mcburney.wisc.edu/facstaffother/faculty/syllabus.php\nUW-Madison students who have experienced sexual misconduct (which can include sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence and/or stalking) also have the right to request academic accommodations. This right is afforded them under Federal legislation (Title IX). Information about services and resources (including information about how to request accommodations) is available through Survivor Services, a part of University Health Services: https://www.uhs.wisc.edu/survivor-services/.",
