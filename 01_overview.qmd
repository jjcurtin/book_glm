# Unit 1: Overview {.unnumbered}


## Today's Outline

- Quick introductions of TAs and me (and you)

- Syllabus and course outline

- General Linear Model framework

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## My Research 

- I am a clinical psychologist with a focus on Substance Use Disorders.

- My laboratory focuses on algorithm development for temporally precise psychiatric risk prediction (e.g., moment by moment relapse risk prediction; efficient and early psychiatric screening) and “just-in-time” personalized interventions that adapt to both characteristics of the patient and their moment in time. 

- To this end, we combine analytic approaches from machine learning with novel, highly informative signals (e.g., geolocation; cellular communications; social media activity; physiology via wearable biosensors) derived by passive personal sensing.

- I also teach an introductory course on Applied Machine Learning each spring (Psychohology 752).

## The General Linear Model

**Top level:** General Linear Models   

**3rd level:** Multiple Regression Models   

**2nd level:** Simple Regression Models   

**Bottom level:** Single Mean Models

\

**Basic Question**  

What is the mean of an outcome/dependent variable in a sample? Is that mean different from some specified value?   

\

**Example**

## Survey of GLM Landscape with One Y

- 610 only adddresses GLMs with a single Y
- 710 handles multiple Ys in the context of repeated measures analyses
- Multivariate statistics courses address other contexts with multiple Ys

### Final, Mind-blowing Wrinkles

- The top-level General Linear Model is itself a special case of an even more general statistical model - the **Generalized Linear Model** - which allows for models with dependent measures (errors really) from different distributions and non-linear link functions connecting $X$s and $Y$s.   

- The General Linear Model can also be thought of as a special case of Structural Equation Modeling.

  - All of the variables that we have described so far are single-indicator, observed variables (i.e., individual constructs of interest are measured using a single task or measure). 

  - Each of the statistics we have described have a multiple-indicator, latent variable analog. They are special cases of these latent models in which there is only one indicator per individual construct.
