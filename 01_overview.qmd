## Today's Outline

- Quick introductions of TAs and me

- Syllabus and course outline

- General Linear Model framework

-----

## My Research 

- I am a clinical psychologist with a focus on Substance Use Disorders.

- My laboratory focuses on algorithm development for temporally precise psychiatric risk prediction (e.g., moment by moment relapse risk prediction; efficient and early psychiatric screening) and “just-in-time” personalized interventions that adapt to both characteristics of the patient and their moment in time. 

- To this end, we combine analytic approaches from machine learning with novel, highly informative signals (e.g., geolocation; cellular communications; social media activity; physiology via wearable biosensors) derived by passive personal sensing.

- I also teach an introductory course on Applied Machine Learning each spring (Psychohology 752).

       Quantitative = c("One sample t-test", "Simple regression; Pearson's r", "Multiple regression"),
       Categorical = c("", "Independent t-test; Point biserial r", "One way ANOVA; Factorial ANOVA"),
       Mixed = c("", "", "ANCOVA; ATI")) |>

## Final, Mind-blowing Wrinkles

- The top-level General Linear Model is itself a special case of an even more general statistical model - the **Generalized Linear Model** - which allows for models with dependent measures (errors really) from different distributions and non-linear link functions connecting $X$s and $Y$s.   

- The General Linear Model can also be thought of as a special case of Structural Equation Modeling.

    - All of the variables that we have described so far are single-indicator, observed variables (i.e., individual constructs of interest are measured using a single task or measure). 

    - Each of the statistics we have described have a multiple-indicator, latent variable analog. They are special cases of these latent models in which there is only one indicator per individual construct.
