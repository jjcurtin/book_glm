## Two Parameter (One Predictor) Models

We started with a very simple model of FPS:

$\hat{FPS}= \beta_0$     

\

- However, we measured their FPS in the context of an experiment where some of the participants were sober and some were given alcohol.   
- And although we standardized the alcohol dose, participants who were given alcohol achieved varying blood alcohol concentrations (BAC)
- Luckily, we measured their BAC as part of the experiment.

-----

# Question

How could we uses their BACs to build a better model of the FPS scores?  What would the model look like?  What question(s) does this model allow us to test?
:::

:::{.fragment}
[**DATA = MODEL + ERROR**]{style="color:blue;"}

- $Y_i= \beta_0+\beta_1*X_1+\varepsilon_i$

- $\hat{Y}_i=\beta_0+\beta_1*X_1$

- $\varepsilon_i = Y_i - \hat{Y}_i$

\

$\hat{FPS}_i=\beta_0+\beta_1*BAC_i$

[We could use this model to test two questions:]{style="color:blue;"}

- [The relationship between BAC and FPS scores]{style="color:blue;"}
- [The typical FPS scores for participants with a specific value for BAC (default is BAC = 0)]{style="color:blue;"}

[Each of these questions will be linked to a test of a specific parameter in the model.]{style="color:blue;"}

## The Two Parameter Model

$\hat{Y}_i=\beta_0+\beta_1*X_1$    

As before, the population parameters in the model ($\beta_0, \beta_1$) are estimated by $b_0$ & $b_1$ calculated from sample data based on the least squares criterion such that they minimize SSE in the sample data.    

\

**Sample model:**   
$\hat{Y}_i=b_0+b_1*X_1$    

\

- To derive these parameter estimates you must solve a series of simultaneous equations using linear algebra and matrices (see supplemental reading).    
- Or use R!

-----

## Least Squares Criterion

$e_i = Y_i- \hat{Y}_i$    

$SSE = \sum e_i^2$   


```{r}
#| echo: false

# add lines to residuals

plot_mean + plot_x
```

-----

## Interpretation of $b_0$ in Two Parameter Model

$\hat{Y}_i=b_0+b_1*X_1$    

- $b_0$ is predicted value for $Y$ when $X_1$ = 0. 
- Graphically, this is the $Y$ intercept for the regression line (value of $Y$ where regression line crosses Y-axis at $X_1$ = 0).

Notice that $b_0$ is very different in the two parameter model (42.5) than in the previous one parameter model (32.2).  Why?

:::

-----

## Interpretation of $b_1$ in Two Parameter Model


$\hat{Y}_i=b_0+b_1*X_1$    

$b_1$ is the predicted change in $Y$ for every one unit change in $X_1$. Graphically it is represented by the slope of the regression line. If you understand the units of your predictor and DV, this is an attractive description of their relationship.   

\

$\hat{FPS}_i=42.5+ -184.1*BAC_i$    

- For every 1% increase in BAC, FPS decreases by 184.1 microvolts.    

- For every .01% increase in BAC, FPS decreases by 1.841 microvolts.

## Mean Centering Predictor Variables

In this example, I have been using raw BAC. In many instances, we will **mean center** our quantitative predictor variables.    

\

Mean centering simply involves subtracting the mean of the predictor variable from all scores for that predictor variable.    

-----

```{r}
data <- data |> 
  mutate(bac_c = bac - mean(bac)) #<1>
```

1. We use `mutate()` to update and create new variables (e.g., centered quantitative predictors, changing character variables to factors).   

-----

```{r}
data |> 
  select(starts_with("bac")) |> 
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "var") |> #<1>
  group_by(var) |> 
  summarize(mean = mean(value), 
            sd = sd(value), 
            min = min(value), 
            max = max(value)) |> 
  mutate(across(mean:max, ~round(.x, 2))) #<2>
```

1. `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` are two tidy functions for transforming your data frame (i.e., wide to long data frame and long to wide data frame).  
2. Here we use `mutate()` again, but are now combing it with `across()` so that we can apply our transformation (rounding to 2 decimal places) to several variables in one statement.

## Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$)

**Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$):**  Proportion of explained variance (i.e., proportion of variance in $Y$ accounted for by all $Xs$ in model).     

\

DATA = MODEL + ERROR    


For individuals:    

- $Y_i=Y_i+e_i$

\

With respect to variance:   

- $S_{Y_i}^2=S_{\hat{Y}_i}^2+S_{e_i}^2$    

- $R^2=\frac{S_{\hat{Y}_i}^2}{S_{Y_i}^2}$   

-----

We can calculate $R^2$ manually by computing the ratio of the variance of the predicted values to the variance of the actual values.   

\

```{r}
var(predict(m_2)) / var(data$fps)
```

-----

We can also use the `glance()` function in the `broom` package to return various model fit indices.  `glance()` returns a dataframe that we can `glimpse()`

```{r}
m_2 |> 
  glance() |>
  glimpse()
```

-----

Since we are only interested in $R^2$ we can use the following code to pull out this single value.

```{r}
glance(m_2)$r.squared
```

or more tidy....

## $R^2$ and the Mean-Only Model

[It did but it was just 0. It explained no variance in $Y_i$ because it predicted the same value (mean) for every person. The variance of the predicted values is 0 in the mean-only model.]{style="color:blue;"}

- $R^2=\frac{S_{\hat{Y}_i}^2}{S_{Y_i}^2}$  

```{r}
m_1 <- lm(fps ~ 1, data = data)  

glance(m_1)$r.squared
```


[In fact, the SSE for the mean-only model is the numerator of the formula for the variance for $Y_i$.]{style="color:blue;"}

- $SSE=\frac{\sum(Y_i-\hat{Y_i})^2}{}$   
- $S^2 = \frac{\sum(Y_i-\overline{Y})^2}{N-1}$
:::

-----

This leads to an alternative formula for $R^2$ for an augmented model.   

$R^2=\frac{SSE_{mean-only}-SSE_a}{SSE_{mean-only}}$   

\

Mean-only model: $\hat{FPS}_i=\beta_0$    

- $SSE_{mean-only} = `r round(sse(m_1), 1)`$    


Augmented model: $\hat{FPS}_i=\beta_0 + \beta_1*BAC_i$     
 
- $SSE_a = `r round(sse(m_2), 1)`$   

\
$R^2= \frac{`r round(sse(m_1), 1)` - `r round(sse(m_2), 1)`}{`r round(sse(m_1), 1)`} = `r round((sse(m_1) - sse(m_2)) / sse(m_1), 5)`$    

\

In this augmented model, $R^2$ is fully accounted for by BAC. In more complex models, $R^2$ will be the aggregate of multiple predictors. $R^2$ is only defined for models that include $b_0$.

## Visualizing the Model

Your model is predicting the mean $Y$ for any $X$. 

- There is a sampling distribution around this mean. 
- The true population mean $Y$ for any $X$ is uncertain. 
- You can display this uncertainty by displaying information about the sampling distribution at any/every $X$.  
- This is equivalent to error bars in ANOVA.  
- There are several choices you have for how to display information about the sampling distribution for the mean (the uncertainty about the population mean)


## Predicted means with 95% Confidence Intervals

The first option is to present the predicted means with a shaded region that represents the 95% CIs for each predicted mean

- 95% of these intervals would be expected to contain the true population mean $Y$ for a given $X$ 
- First, we need values for BAC for which to make predictions.  We can put them into an dataframe 
 
\

```{r}
x <- tibble(bac = seq(from = min(data$bac), to = max(data$bac), by = .001))
```

-----

To get predicted mean FPS for each of these BACs, we use the `predict()` function

- We use the model object from `lm()`
- We pass that model into the `predict()` function, along with the data
- We set the `interval` to "confidence" and the appropriate `level`
- We then put the BACs into this dataframe to keep everything together (this could all be done in one pipeline but kept separate here to make it clearer)
\

```{r}
preds <- predict(m_2, x, interval = "confidence", level = .95) |> 
  as_tibble() 

preds <- preds |> 
  bind_cols(x)
```

-----

```{r}
preds  |> slice_head(n = 20)
```

-----

- We can now plot the raw data from the `data` dataframe
- We can plot the model line and confidence intervals using BACs and predicted Ys in `preds`

\

```{r}
ci_plot <- ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = data$bac, y = data$fps), alpha = .6, size = 2) +
  geom_line(aes(x = preds$bac, y = preds$fit),
              color = "black", linewidth = 1) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(x = preds$bac, ymin = preds$lwr, ymax = preds$upr), alpha = 0.2) +
  labs(x = "BAC",
       y = "FPS") 
```

-----

```{r}
ci_plot
```

The confidence intervals for each predicted FPS score use the standard error for these predicted values.

# Question
Why are the error bands not linear?
:::


:::{.fragment}
[Model predictions are better (less error) near the center of your data ($X_i$).  The regression line will always go through mean of $X$ and $Y$. Small changes in $b_1$ across samples will produce bigger variation in $\hat{Y}_i$ at the edge of the model (far from the mean $X$).]{style="color:blue;"}

$\hat{FPS_i}=42.5 + -184.1 * BAC_i$    

$SE_\hat{Y_i}=\sqrt{\frac{SSE}{N-P}}*\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}+\frac{(X_i-\overline{X})^2}{(N-1)s_x^2}}$  

$CI_\hat{Y_i}=\hat{Y_i}\pm t(\alpha; N-k-1)SE_\hat{Y_i}$
:::

-----

Lets compare the SE for $b_0$ to the standard error for $\hat{Y_i}$ at different values of $X_i$.

\

$SE_\hat{Y_i}=\sqrt{\frac{SSE}{N-P}}*\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}+\frac{(X_i-\overline{X})^2}{(N-1)s_x^2}}$  

$SE_{b_0}=\sqrt{\frac{SSE}{N-P}}*\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}+\frac{(\overline{X})^2}{(N-1)s_x^2}}$   

\

- $b_0$ is simply the predicted value for $Y$ when $X$ = 0.

- We can use additive transformations of $X$ to make tests of the predicted value at  $X$ = 0. Most common in repeated measures designs but used elsewhere as well.


-----

## A Second Option for Displaying Model


In some disciplines, it is more common to display the uncertainty regarding predicted mean Y using +/- 1 SE rather than the full 95% CI (which is ~ +/- 2 SE)

\

We can get this out of `predict()` as well.

\

```{r}
preds <- predict(m_2, x, se.fit = TRUE) |> 
  as_tibble() 

preds <- preds |> 
  bind_cols(x) |> 
  mutate(upr = fit + se.fit, 
         lwr = fit - se.fit)
```

-----

```{r}
preds  |> slice_head(n = 20)
```

-----


```{r}
se_plot <- ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = data$bac, y = data$fps), alpha = .6, size = 2) +
  geom_line(aes(x = preds$bac, y = preds$fit),
              color = "black", linewidth = 1) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(x = preds$bac, ymin = preds$lwr, ymax = preds$upr), alpha = 0.2) +
  labs(x = "BAC",
       y = "FPS") 
```


```{r}
se_plot
```

-----

There is a final plot that you will not see often but is worth understanding conceptually.  In this plot we represent uncertainty about the predictions for individuals rather than the mean Y.  

- This is called a prediction interval, rather than a confidence interval
- You can get this interval from `predict()` as well
- This plot uses the approximately 2 SEE around the predicted means
- 95% of these intervals will capture any raw Y in the population

```{r}
preds <- predict(m_2, x, interval = "prediction", level = 0.95) |> 
  as_tibble() 

preds <- preds |> 
  bind_cols(x)
```

-----

```{r}
preds  |> slice_head(n = 20)
```

-----

```{r}
pred_plot <- ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = data$bac, y = data$fps), alpha = .6, size = 2) +
  geom_line(aes(x = preds$bac, y = preds$fit),
              color = "black", linewidth = 1) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(x = preds$bac, ymin = preds$lwr, ymax = preds$upr), alpha = 0.2) +
  labs(x = "BAC",
       y = "FPS")

pred_plot 
```

## Look at what we now know!!!


- We now understand how to create a two parameter model of $\hat{Y}$ based on a single predictor variable coded as $X$
- We understand how to interpret the parameter estimates in this model ($b_0$ and $b_1$)
- We understand that these parameters are estimated such that the minimize the SSE in our sample
- We understand how to form null and alternative hypotheses about these parameters
- We can test those hypotheses using either a t-test based on the sampling distribution for the parameter estimate or an F-test comparing the augmented model to a compact model
- We understand how to interpret the t-statistic in terms of standard deviations from the mean of the sampling distribution under the null
- For the model comparison approach, we can specify the form of the compact model and augmented model for tests of $\Beta_0$ and $\Beta_1$
- We know how to calculate and interpret confidence intervals for these parameters
- We know how to calculate and interpret an effect size estimate ($\eta_p^2$ or PRE) for these parameters
- We know how to calculate and interpret $R^2$ for the overall model both in terms of variance explained and in terms of reduction in SSE from the mean-only model
- We know how to visualize these models
