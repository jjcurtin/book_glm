[A new slide shows the answer, too.]{style="color:green;"}


## Callout

Alas, this wonderful feature does not work in revealJS

::: {.callout-important collapse="true"}

### This is the question you want displayed?

Here's the answer! This can be as long as you want but only in HTML.

## Code Folding

Our previous final solution was code folding, BUT, this only works if you only displaying text. As soon as you try to include a graph in the callout, the graph itself is visible before you click:

::: {.callout-important collapse="false"}
## If the DGP for y is a cubic function of x, what do we know about the expected bias for our three candidate model configurations in this example?

```{html}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show Answer"
The simple linear model will underfit the true DGP and therefore it will be biased b/c 
it can only represent y as a linear function of x.  

The two polynomial models will be generally unbiased b/c they have x represented 
with 20th order polynomials.  

LASSO will be slightly biased due to regularization but more on that in a later unit

```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show code"
# A graph 
plot(mtcars$disp, mtcars$qsec)
```

## Hello Fragments!!

This is a new revealJS feature does exactly what we want! A "fragment" only appears when you click, as if advancing the slide.

In this case I have hidden both the question and the answer. This forces people to read/listen and not just jump to the question:

:::{.fragment}
[Here's a question?]{style="color:red;"}
:::

:::{.fragment}
[Here's the answer.]{style="color:green;"}

You can also use the .fragment specification on an image without the triple-colon fences:
:::

![](https://quarto.org/quarto.png){.fragment}


## Nested Fragments

Nested fragments allow us to hide code or a graph in our answer as well.

::: {.callout-important}
## What is the question?
:::

:::{.fragment}
Here's an answer. Advance again to see a graph!

:::{.fragment}


```{r}
#| echo: true
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess")
```
:::
:::


## Nested Fragments 2

Maybe you want the code to appear before the output. In that case, use nested fragments and ALSO specify the output-location code chunk as fragment:

::: {.callout-important}
## What is the question?
:::

:::{.fragment}
Here's an answer. Only the code will appear next:

:::{.fragment}


```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess")
```

## Question stying

I've gone back and forth between using a simple red styling and applying the callout styling to a question. Here are a few options side by side. Styling and fragment can be applied in the same braces.

::: {.fragment .callout-important}
## Question with callout styling
:::

[Answer]{.fragment style="color:green;"} 

### Question as header (bold/larger text) with red styling{.fragment style="color:red;"}

[Answer]{.fragment style="color:green;"} 


[Question as text with red styling]{.fragment style="color:red;"}

[Answer]{.fragment style="color:green;"} 


[I also tested fragments with printing. All fragments are revealed in the output when using ctrl-P from a browser!]{.fragment style="color:blue;"}
